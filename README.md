:innocent: Motivation
Approximately 285 million people worldwide are visually impaired, and this project aims to provide them with a seamless task management system. The motivation behind this initiative is to create an accessible communication platform that overcomes the limitations of existing systems, which heavily rely on mouse click events and keyboard shortcuts, making it challenging for visually impaired users. The system focuses on fundamental functionalities such as task creation, completion, and deletion.

:bulb: Working
The program operates as follows:

Upon launching the application, the user is prompted to log in.
After a successful login, the menu page appears, prompting the user for voice commands such as "Create Task," "Mark Task as Complete," "View Tasks," and "Logout."
The user can navigate through tasks using voice commands, creating new tasks, marking tasks as complete, or deleting them.
The system is designed to provide a simple and intuitive interface for visually impaired users.
